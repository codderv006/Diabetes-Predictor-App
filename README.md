The web app takes user input for various required parameters like BMI level, number of pregnancies, age, etc. of the person.
And predicts and displays the results.

- The model is trained using the PIMA diabetes dataset
- Uses SVM algorithm.
- The web app is built using Streamlit.
- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, sklearn

## Accuracy levels
- Accuracy score of the training data:  78.664%
- Accuracy score of the test data:  77.272%
